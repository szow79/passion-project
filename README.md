# passion-project
PriceChart is my passion project that helps users to keep track of prices for items they would like to buy for a better price. Users can add an item to their account and a price chart will be generated from the date it is added. At the moment it supports bestbuy products. Technology stack includes Ruby, sinatra, nokogiri, and Google charts.
